# Learning
Resources for research, software engineering and other things

## Structure

Each major topic area is placed in its own markdown file.  
Within each major topic area each subtopic receives its own sub-heading,
with two sections. The first section is a self check.
This is not intended to be exhaustive but to represent the level of knowledge required to master the subtopic.
The second section is intended to provide the necessary resources in order to learn the material.
